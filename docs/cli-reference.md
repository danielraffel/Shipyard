## JSON output

Every command supports `--json` for structured output with a versioned
schema, intended for AI agent consumption:

```bash
shipyard run --json
shipyard ship --json
shipyard status --json
```

The envelope always carries `schema_version: 1` and the command name, so
agents can pin to a stable contract.

`shipyard status` is intentionally limited to queue/target state and does not
probe GitHub quota. Use `shipyard doctor --rate-limit` when you need to confirm
whether Shipyard is using ambient `gh`, an env token, or a command helper such
as a GitHub App installation token, and to see the current REST and GraphQL
rate-limit buckets.
